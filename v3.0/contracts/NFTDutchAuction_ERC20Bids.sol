/**
* @title NFTDutchAuction_ERC20Bids Smart Contract
* @author SaiMahith Chigurupati
* Note
* Create a new directory in your Github repo called v3.0 and initialize a new hardhat project.
* Copy over any files you can reuse from the previous versions of this project into the directory for this version.
* Create a new contract called NFTDutchAuction_ERC20Bids.sol. It should have the same functionality as NFTDutchAuction.sol but accepts only ERC20 bids instead of Ether.
* The constructor for the NFTDutchAuction_ERC20Bids.sol should be:
* constructor(address erc20TokenAddress, address erc721TokenAddress, uint256 _nftTokenId, uint256 _reservePrice, uint256 _numBlocksAuctionOpen, uint256 _offerPriceDecrement)
* Write test cases to thoroughly test your contracts. Generate a Solidity coverage report and commit it to your repository under this versionâ€™s directory.
